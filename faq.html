            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
     
            <p class="faqCard__answer">The Rokettonauts met at a festival where they were able to see the benefits of rockets (the salad). Since then, they have traveled the world, the web and the galaxy in order to share their knowledge of this precious food. Did you know it is a source of Vitamin K? You're welcome.</p>

            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
        
            <p class="faqCard__answer">Our love for rocket leaf and the web development galaxy of course. But also this is a group project so it is more likely we've been encouraged to be together. Still, we do love rocket and the web galaxy so destiny does play a good game. </p>

            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
    
            <p class="faqCard__answer">Roketto means family but it also represents salad to be honest. </p>

            <h2 class="faqCard__question">What mission impacted you the most?</h2>
    
            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
        
            <p class="faqCard__answer">The mission that impacted us the most was the chiwawas rescue on planet Omicron Persei8. The Omicronians dognapped tiny dogs after viewing "the chiwawa of berverly hills" and became fans of them. Since then, all the chiwawas were returned to their owners and friends on planet Earth. A crazy story.</p>

            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
        
            <p class="faqCard__answer">There are not enough words to sum up the adventure but we could say that Roketto pulls you out of your blackhole with their cosmic ideas. So if you decide to embark with us don't forget to fasten your seatbelt. It is truly a life changing experience.</p>

            <h2 class="faqCard__question">How can one join the Roketto team?</h2>
    
            <span class="faqCard__button"></span>
        
            <p class="faqCard__answer">It is a very tough and demanding process. You must follow several steps that are so hard that they often made people abandon their applications. Some qualified the process as being "harder than for Nasa". But let's cut out the suspens and get to the point. To join the team, you need to have an email, get a roket leaf tattoo and love.</p>
